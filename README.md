Visual Routines: an application for improving the lives of children/adults with autism














Project summary
Visual Routines is an app designed for Autistic children and adults. The basis of the idea is a visual routine app that is simple and clear for the autistic children that reduces stress and anxiety that comes along with change. I wanted to produce an idea with something I am passionate about and would produce positive change if ever brought to life. Overall, the focus of the project was to show my development of technical skills and the comprehensive documentation alongside this.

Project management 
Project management ensures there is an appropriate plan for executing and delivering a product or service to a client. Before implementing the project, it was crucial to justify the projects needs to develop the scope, objectives and requirements. 
From the initial project planning, I decided on an agile approach rather than a traditional one. This allows for iterative approach. 

Project methodology 
In the project management of this project, I chose to implement an agile approach. Using an agile methodology, it allows me to develop the project in different phases with a iterative approach. This methodology was effective to allow changes within the project as it progresses. It also allows updates from feedback gotten. 
To improve effectiveness of the development of the application, I used an online scrum tool called Trello. This was used due to its comprehensive tool set for use cases, responsibilities and roles. 
By doing iterative and incremental sprints I learned what worked and what didn’t. feedback from the tutors also provided valuable insight and improved progress.



Project objectives
•	To create a CRUD project-Create, Read, Update, Delete
•	To use supporting technologies and methodologies to support the core modules taught
•	To show an understanding of core concepts such as: project management; C# fundamentals; Git; Basic Linux; Angular; Continuous Integration; Cloud Fundamentals and Databases.

Scope
•	The use of project management technologies such as trello. The use of user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete project.
•	A relational database with at least 2 tables to show understanding
•	Clear documentation including a risk assessment 
•	A functional CRUD application created with c#
•	Fully designed test suites for application – support TDD approach 
•	Fully functional front end using c# and angular 
•	Code fully integrated into a version control system using the feature branch model which will be built through CI
Project background/Autism info
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a broad range of conditions charactertized by challenges with social skills, communication and repetitive behaviours. These repetitive behaviours make change very difficult and routine is a core foundation to a happy child.  visual schedule Is helpful for breaking down tasks and promotes effective teaching and compliance. It decreases anxiety and stress throughout the day. Visual supports are used with children on the Austism Spectrum as a form of communication and promotes understanding.
Benefits of a Visual Autism Application 
1.	Provides organization, structure and predictability to the day 
2.	Support literacy development – words are alongside the images
3.	Reinforces and supplements verbal instructions 
4.	Teaches time concepts and sequencing 
5.	Teaches responsibility and planning
6.	Eases transitions – switching tasks can be extremely tough for children with autism 
7.	Decreases anxiety and stress
8.	Provides independence 
9.	Builds self esteem and promotes self actualization when checking things off a list
10.	Plays to the strengths of children with autism – they are visual learners 
11.	Allows change to occur more easily – change is difficult for kids with autism

My Approach
The approach I have used for Visual Studio is as follows:
This approach was devised by the prioritisation of the most important aspects due to the limited time frame:
•	Create a CRUD application. 
o	The application must be able to CREATE a new task 
o	The application must be able to UPDATE a created task
o	The application must be able to READ the tasks
o	The application must be able to DELETE a task
•	Be able to create:
o	Name of the task
o	The time of the task divided into 4 simple times of day : Morning, Noon, Afternoon and night
o	The description of the task 
o	A picture URL 
•	Create a second table called Goals (either CRUD functionality or populated with generic goals if ran out of time)
•	Create an API for the frontend 
•	Create extensive testsuites
Additionally, I would like to allow the user to:
•	Be able to login however this could be out of my time frame 
•	Have a simple yet visual front end 



Risk analysis 
Risk analysis and management is key to project management to ensure the least amount of unexpected liabilities. Successful risk analysis involved continuous risk identification, risk evaluation, risk mitigation and contingency measures and risk monitoring & control.



RISKS	LIKILIHOOD	SEVERITY	CONTROL MEASURE	REVISIT
7/5/2021
Accidently deleting code	Low 	High 	Backing up all code	Low because of github and constant pushing to the repository once code works 
Gold plating (adding additional features that weren’t asked for)	medium	medium	Keeping to the Scope of Work/replanning scope at each iteration	Low 
Lack of knowledge	high	high	Keeping up with the workload, reaching out if need help 	Medium-learning a lot as I go and tutorials are a lot of help however bugs are difficult to solve 
Technical issue: application isn’t stable i.e application crashes, has bugs etc	medium	high	Continuous testing and continuous integration	High- solution folder had a lot of issues and had to restart code
Time Management: running out of time 	medium	medium	Using agile methodologies and project management tools	Very high
				
				

Analysis of risk analysis:
Risk management is difficult as we cannot predict the future with certainty although by evaluating the risks we can help avoid a crisis and improves the successful completion of projects. 
By adding control measures it allows for decreased risk such as the deletion of code. Backing the code up to GitHub as a control measure allowed me to go back to original code when I had an issue with code I had. I unfortunately had a bug I could not overcome with the API and as a result I went back to the CRUD development part of the code. Although this took me a step backwards, I needed to go backwards to go forward in this case and the control in the risk evaluation enabled this.


Time Management:
Managing a project schedule and timeline is one of the key factors in successfully completing and delivering a project. Several online collaboration software tools  were used including Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, and Trello to manage time efficiently. 
Technologies used:
1.	Trello 
2.	Azure Virtual Machine (Database)
3.	Virtual Studio (C#, html, css, javascript)
4.	Git (Version Control)
5.	Azure DevOps (CI Server)
6.	Azure App Service (Cloud Server)

Project management tools
•	Trello: Project Management Software’s (PMS) is a tool that helps to organize, manage resources and develop resource estimates. PMS is a Software-as-Software (SaaS). It assists to manage goals and long-term projects. 

Trello allows for effective Project Management. It is a visual collaboration tool that was used to plan this project. It is commonly used with agile methodology and allows to prioritize tasks. 

Benefits of Trello:
1.	Well organized Board and cards system : it allows for a comprehensive progress view and maximizes clarity.
2.	Security: trello is designed with high security standards and can be used with sensitive data. 
3.	Flexibility: trello can be used with both group projects and individual projects.
4.	Cloud storage: trello allows cloud storage with android and ios apps. You can manage projects anywhere without having access to a hard drive.

•	Github: github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. Features include the ability to make repositories, branches, commits and pull/push requests.

Benefits of GitHib:
1.	Collaboration: GitHub allows for collaboration between developers anywhere in the world 
2.	Restoration of work: GitHub allows to commit your work to GitHib and fetch it back to your system. This ensures there is a back up of code and developers working on your code aren’t directly editing it.

Challenges
•	Time management : time constraints was the biggest challenge of this project. It was difficult to get a grasp on the concepts and do a high quality of work while having limited time. 
•	Challenges with code issues: the second issue I have caused some of the timing issues. Due to inexperience, bugs in the code would take a long time to figure out. However, the more I worked on the project the better I got at problem solving in c sharp
Issues 
•	This project had a lot of issues arising to me. The main issue I had was visual studio not responding and having to quit causing my files to get corrupted. Although I had saved them frequently my laptop did decide to have technical difficulties when I needed it least. 
•	 The biggest issue I had was the API not running for me. It kept showing up errors and somewhat broke my code.
•	 
Solutions to challenges:
•	Time management: due to time constraints I analysed the situation and prioritized based on the marking scheme, the functionality of the project and the overall integrity of my work. I chose to focus on testing rather than the CRUD functionality of my second table. I felt that because I had shown CRUD in my first table that it showed my ability and it would be more beneficial to show off my ability to test my application.
•	Challenges with code issues: this was a challenge early on however as I started my project more in depth I would push my code to GitHub each time I had functionality with no bugs so that I could always restore my code if I to create a bug I could not fix.
Future enhancements
•	This is an application I would love to come to life!! It is not already a combined application for people with autism and I think it has potential to improve the lives of children/adults with autism 
•	I would improve the front end while keeping the simplicity. Perhaps adding more colour into the application
•	I make it a cross platform application to be able to use it on your phone/ipad
•	I would add a login functionality along with a admin/user capability so that there are different accessibilities for both 

Database systems 
The objective: to create a relational database used to store data for the project. This database needs at least 2 tables to demonstrate understanding.
-Task Table: CRUD ability
-Goal Table
 
Fig: the two tables in the relational database created through visual studio and updated in the package manager
 
Fig: task table with the datatypes and fields used
 
Fig : goal table with the databases and fields used



Crud functionality 
Project objective: to create a fully functional CRUD application that can create, read, update and delete.
This application is a fully functional app that can create new tasks, show all tasks, show the details to one task, update this task and delete.
Deploying the application
The application is deployed using azure app service.  

Licensing
-Visual Studio: All Visual Studio subscriptions are licensed on a per-user basis. Each licensed user may install and use the software on any number of devices to design, develop, test, and demonstrate their programs.
-GitHub: There are 3 main licenses on GitHub
1.The MIT License, which is meant to be extremely straightforward and open. It permits users to do anything with a given project as long as they credit the developer and don’t hold him or her liable for the project’s use.
2.The Apache License, which is similar to the MIT License, but also explicitly grants patent rights to users.
3.The GPL License, which is older, more limiting, and less popular than the other two. It is a copyleft license that requires users to track their changes if they modify and then distribute a project. Different versions of this license also restrict the use of modified code in various classes of hardware.
-Azure: There are several license plans available for Azure AD including Azure AD free, Azure AD Premium and Azure AD Premium P2.

Testing 
What needs to be tested: Services, Controllers, C sharp classes, if its returning the right data, if its returning the right entity. 
Why do testing: an iterative process of analysis, unit test development and refactoring can help you make your production code more robust and effective. 
There are three kinds of tests: Unit Tests, Integration Tests and Load Test. 
Within Unit Tests there are three commonly used ones: xUnit, NUnit and MSTest.
How we write the Unit Test: 
1. I used Xunit but it is possible to use any testing framework 
2. Decide what you want to test
3. Create a new project
4. Create a new item: add a class file and add reference to unit test 
5. Import XUnit
6. Make a function and test the returned data (Arrange, Art, Assert)
7. Run on Test Explorer
-Arrange: Select item you want to test eg task
-Act: Returns model
-Assert: can assert multiple things i.e NotNull, IsType

Integration tests
Integration testing is defined as testing whereby software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. It focuses on checking the data communication among the modules and is also known as Integration and Testing. 
Integration tests come after Unit tests, although unit testing tests the modules it is important to test the connection and flow of data in the program.
